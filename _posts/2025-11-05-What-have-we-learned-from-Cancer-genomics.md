# Major Lessons from Tumor Sequencing

### 1. Many mutations — but only a few matter
Tumors can carry thousands of mutations, but only a handful actually “drive” cancer.  
Vogelstein compared cancer genomes to **mountains** (genes frequently mutated across tumors) and **hills** (genes mutated more rarely).

### 2. Common pathways, diverse mutations
Even though individual genes differ across tumors, **driver mutations cluster into a few biological pathways**.  
These pathways control essential processes such as **cell survival**, **cell fate**, and **genome maintenance**.

### 3. Mutation burden varies
Some cancers, like **melanoma** or **lung cancer**, have very high mutation rates due to UV or smoking exposure,  
while **pediatric cancers** have far fewer mutations.

### 4. Tumor evolution and heterogeneity
Sequencing shows that tumors aren’t uniform — they are made up of **subclones** that evolve over time.  
This explains why cancers often **relapse** or **develop resistance** to therapy.

### 5. Unexpected discoveries
Newly identified **driver genes** affect diverse cellular processes, including **chromatin structure**,  
**RNA splicing**, and **metabolism** — revealing new mechanisms of cancer development.

### 6. Precision medicine potential
Genomic data now guide therapy. Drugs that target specific mutations show how sequencing can  
**personalize cancer treatment** and improve patient outcomes.

## Challenges Ahead
Distinguishing **driver** from **passenger** mutations remains difficult.  
Coping with tumor heterogeneity and turning discoveries into effective treatments are still major hurdles.  
Many mutations are also **undruggable**, limiting current therapeutic options.

---

## Conclusion
Genomic sequencing has transformed cancer research by showing that beneath the apparent chaos of thousands of mutations,  
only a small set truly drives tumor growth. These insights have paved the way for **precision oncology**,  
allowing treatments to be tailored to each tumor’s genetic makeup.
